Hi! I'm Elian Giordano, a soon-to-be development economics graduate.

In the last two years, I attended a program called MEDEG, which stands for Master in Economic Development and Growth jointly offered by the [Universidad Carlos III de Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/master/medeg#home), Spain, and [Lund University](https://www.lusem.lu.se/study/masters-programmes/economic-development-and-growth-masters-programme), Sweden.

Currently, I am working as an adjunct lecturer at the Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona, Spain, where I teach Microeconomics and Econometrics I. At the same time I am supporting the project [Digiwell](https://sites.google.com/view/progettodigiwell/home-page?authuser=0) led by Prof. Marinella Leone (Università di Pavia). Furthermore, I am part of the [data replicator team](https://jpe-reproducibility.github.io/replicator-team/) led by Florian Oswald at the Journal of Political Economy.

I am also a proud alumnus of [IPLE](https://www.unimi.it/en/education/bachelor/international-politics-law-and-economics-iple), a bachelor's programme at the Università degli Studi di Milano, Italy.

Apart from the academic fuss, I enjoy my time eating and texting with my friends. A glass of wine may be a good excuse to meet and talk about politics.

Don't take this website too seriously. For those who know me, I can be labelled as a stubborn and perfectionist person (or procrastinator, depending on the point of view). Bad combination.

I still haven't said the buzzword of my conversations, that is the place where I come from: [Minori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minori,_Campania), Italy. It might be that you passed by while visiting the infamous Amalfi and Positano. It's usually the case.

I hope this wasn't too long. At least you got a good overview before putting yourself in trouble by contacting me.
