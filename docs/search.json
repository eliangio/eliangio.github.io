    "text": "Last Update: 9 Oct 2025\n\n\n\n\nHi! I’m Elian Giordano, a soon-to-be development economics graduate.\nIn the last two years, I attended a program called MEDEG, which stands for Master in Economic Development and Growth joinly offered by the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain, and Lund University, Sweden.\nCurrently, I am working as an adjunct lecturer at the Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona, Spain, where I teach Microeconomía and Econometría I.\nFurthermore, I am part of the data replicator team led by Florian Oswald at the Journal of Political Economy.\nI am also a proud alumnus of IPLE, a bachelor’s programme at the Università degli Studi di Milano, Italy.\nApart from the academic fuss, I enjoy my time eating and texting with my friends. A glass of wine may be a good excuse to meet and talk about politics.\nDon’t take this website too seriously. For those who know me, I can be labelled as a stubborn and perfectionist person (or procrastinator, depending on the point of view). Bad combination.\nI still haven’t said the buzzword of my conversations, that is the place where I come from: Minori, Italy. It might be that you passed by while visiting the infamous Amalfi and Positano. It’s usually the case.\nI hope this wasn’t too long. At least you got a good overview before putting yourself in trouble by contacting me."
